   abstract = {Hops (Humulus lupulus L.) are used traditionally in the brewing industry to confer bitterness, aroma, and flavor to beer. However, in recent years, it has been reported that female inflorescences contain a huge variety of bioactive compounds. Due to the growing interest of the consumers by natural ingredients, intense research has been carried out in the last years to find new sources of functional molecules. This review collects the works about the bioactive potential of hops with applications in the food, pharmaceutical, or cosmetic industries. Moreover, an overview of the main extraction technologies to recover biomolecules from hops is shown. Bioactivities of hop extracts such as antibacterial, antifungal, cardioprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, and antiviral are also summarized. It can be concluded that hops present a high potential of bioactive ingredients with high quality that can be used as preservative agents in fresh foods, extending their shelf life, and they can be incorporated in cosmetic formulation for skincare as well.},
